description: Take an unexpected trip into the past in this gem of golden-era science
  fiction from Murray Leinster. On what appears to be an ordinary workday, Arthur
  Chamberlain, a successful engineer based in Manhattan, notices that the sun appears
  to be traveling backwards in the sky. Chamberlain is the only person who is able
  to discern the truth of the situation. Can he devise a solution to reverse it in
  time to save himself and thousands of his coworkers?
